# TicTacToe
This assignment is solved in groups of two students.

Your assignment is to use the object-oriented programming paradigm to create a card game, dice game, board game or other game of your choice using the Java programming language (you can find some examples later under 2.1). The assignment has three parts:

Specification: In this part you identify the game you will create, how it should work, which rules it has and which requirements it needs fulfill. A UML Use case diagram is expected to specify the interactions with the game.
Design: In this part you analyze the requirements you elicited in the previous part and create an OO design of the game. A UML class diagram is expected to describe your design.
Implementation. In this part you need to implement the game based on the above design.
The goal of the assignment is to gather experience with developing a somewhat larger (compared to previous assignments at least) software solution using object-oriented techniques. Software development is iterative and this means that both requirements, design and implementation can change during the development.

The three steps as well as the detailed requirements are elaborated further in the next section. At the end of the course, your work will result in a working game as well as a report which describes what your game is, how is it structured and why is it structured like that. The report should also include the above specification and design parts of your work.
